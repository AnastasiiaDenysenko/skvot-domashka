        <p class="movie-description font2">Pieced together from Timothy Treadwell's actual video footage, Werner Herzog's remarkable documentary examines the calling that drove Treadwell to live among a tribe of wild grizzly bears on an Alaskan reserve. A devoted conservationist with a passion for adventure, Timothy believed he had bridged the gap between human and beast. When one of the bears he loved and protected tragically turns on him, the footage he shot serves as a window into our understanding of nature and its grim realities.</p>

        <p class="font-size-24">Werner Herzog</p>
        <p class="font2">Werner Herzog is an iconic German director, writer, author of over 60 films. His movies have received more than 50 awards and nominations, from the Berlinaleâ€™s Silver Bear for Best Feature Debut Signs of Life back in 1968, to an Oscar nomination for his documentary Encounters at the End of the World in 2009. Herzog is a unique filmmaker: critics consider him to be a part of the New German Cinema (along with Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Wim Wenders), but Herzog himself has always denied it; the director is famous both for his fiction features and his documentaries.</p>
